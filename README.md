# Chronic-Kidney-disease-classification

Developed a system for early-stage chronic kidney disease (
CKD
) detection.
•
Utilized data pre-processing techniques and multiple classification models (
KNN, Decision tree, Random forest, AdaBoost, GradientBoost, Xgboost, Catboost, ExtraTree, lightgbm
) for CKD classification.
•
Optimized models through
hyperparameter tuning
using
GridSearchCV
.
•
Decision Tree model emerged as the top performer with 99% accuracy for both test and training datasets and a recall value of 96%.
